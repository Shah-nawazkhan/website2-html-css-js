            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Tourism is travel for pleasure or business, and the commercial activity
                of providing and supporting such travel.The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally,
                in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only",
                as people "travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one
                consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes". Tourism can be
                domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both
                incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Tourism in Pakistan is a growing industry. In 2010, Lonely Planet termed
                Pakistan "tourism's 'next big thing'". The country is geographically and ethnically diverse, and has a
                number of historical and cultural heritage sites. Cond√© Nast Traveller ranked Pakistan The Best Holiday
                Destination for 2020 and also declared it the third-highest potential adventure destination in the world
                for 2020. As security in the country improves, tourism increases; in two years, it has increased by more
                than 300%. The Pakistani government had launched online visa services for 175 countries and 50 countries
                were offered visa on arrival, making visiting Pakistan easier. The country received an influx of travel
                vloggers, who promoted the characteristics of the country, such as in the Northern Pakistan, like Hunza
                and Skardu.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">International tourism is tourism that crosses national borders.
                Globalisation has made tourism a popular global leisure activity. The World Tourism Organization defines
                tourists as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than
                one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes".The World Health Organization (WHO)
                estimates that up to 500,000 people are in flight at any one time.

                In 2010, international tourism reached US$919B, growing 6.5% over 2009, corresponding to an increase in
                real terms of 4.7%. In 2010, there were over 940 million international tourist arrivals worldwide. By
                2016 that number had risen to 1,235 million, producing 1,220 billion USD in destination spending. The
                COVID-19 crisis had significant negative effects on international tourism significantly slowing the
                overall increasing trend..</p>
